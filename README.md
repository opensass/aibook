## üë®‚Äçüíª Data Models

![MongDB Models](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2f430c3-3d5a-491d-9fc9-b833a555cbc1)

AIBook is powered by a MongoDB storage. The following a closer look at the data models and how they interconnect:

- **User**: Manages user information, credentials, and roles, allowing for secure, authenticated access.
- **Book**: Stores book-specific details, including title, type, and main topics, as well as creation and update timestamps.
- **Chapter**: Holds chapter content in both markdown and HTML formats.
- **Conversation**: Logs conversations between users and the Gemini AI.
- **Message**: Captures individual messages within each conversation.
- **Subscription**: Manages user subscription plans, payment methods, and active status.

## ü§ñ Gemini AI Integration

The Gemini AI integration is a core part of AIBook‚Äôs functionality. When users generate a chapter, the `generate_chapter_content` function utilizes the "gems" crate to send a structured prompt to the Gemini AI, requesting content in markdown format for editor use and HTML format for publishing. The AI‚Äôs responses are saved in MongoDB, allowing users to retrieve, update, or regenerate content as needed.
